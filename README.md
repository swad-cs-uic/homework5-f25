## Homework 5

## Quickstart

Create a new **private** repository under your own GitHub account
from [this template](https://github.com/swad-cs-uic/homework5-f24).

## Installing required packages

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the
dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Skeleton code

The homework provided is focused on optimizing React applications using various
performance-enhancing techniques. You will work through four main problems, each
highlighting a different optimization strategy:

- Memoize expensive calculation results with useMemo
- Prevent UI blocking with Web Workers
- Optimize event handlers with useCallback and memo
- Virtualize long lists with react-window

## Running the application

To run the application, type `npm run dev` in the terminal. This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Deliverables

Your submission should properly implement optimization techniques according to the
instructions for each of the problems.

## Testing

To test your implementation, run `npm run test`.
